I would take these load ratings with a grain of salt. They may not be rated for what they actually claim to be. I have a similar model of TSINY DC GEARED motor I uploaded and two of them have broken on me without even going through a quarter of the stall torque load that they are rated for. It's 6V, 1 rpm.
